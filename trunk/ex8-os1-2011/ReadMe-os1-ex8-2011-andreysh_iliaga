 			Server:
 				./ex7_server X Y
			X		-  working time
			Y		-  port for connection
		 		
 			Client
	 			./ex7_client X Y Z
	 		X		-  hostname or ip adress
 			Y		-  port of server
 			Z		-  multiplier (1,5)

============================= ex8_server ======================================
Provide server for clients which calculated pi
Server waiting X=argv[1] seconds and waiting for connections on port
Y=argv[2]
Handling connection happens immediately, and then counted for 
the math task. After a timeout the server receives the signal and 
then used it closes out the connection.

For exit can press ^C


============================= ex8_client ======================================
This program is calculated pi and send him to server.
The connect with using tcp/ip
The client can get two tipes of adress
First is simple ip address	
Second is domain name.

	- First Parameter which client get is ip adress or host name of serever
	- Second is port
	- Third is multiplier used in monte carlo method which can be between 1-5

	* calcylation of pai: we retrive multiple form user that pultipling number
10000 and that number randomize to calculate pai thrugh MONTE CARLO method.

/*
	client which connected to server and send him
	the pi value are is calculeted in function culcPai by MonteCarlo method.
