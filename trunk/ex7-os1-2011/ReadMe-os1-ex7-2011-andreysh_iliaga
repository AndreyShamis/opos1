 			Client
	 			./ex7_client X Y
	 		X		-  id of internal queue comunication
 			Y		-  multple of pai calculation.

============================= ex7_server ======================================
	At first, The server criate queue of messegs, than it retreive 
from clients pi value and mutple in evry messege he get.
	The server get number of messege as 
number of seconds that user give as argument to the server program. 
	Each second the chek server if he get messege and 
if there is - he save it to linked list.
	After that we calculate the everage of all pai value that we get 
(the calculation include multple value).
In the end the program we print the evarage pai value and close messege queue. 

//	server for clients which calculated pi
//	and send it to server.
//	Server waiting X second and wait for argv[3] .X mast be provided in argv-2.



============================= ex7_client ======================================
	At first, client open the msg for send to server the pi which gona be 
calculated. 
	Then we calculate the pai value an d send it to server.

	* calcylation of pai: we retrive multiple form user that pultipling number
1000 and that number randomize to calculate pai thrugh MOTE CARLO method.

/*
	client which connected to server and send him
	the pi value are is calculeted in function culcPai by MonteCarlo method.
