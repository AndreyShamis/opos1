##  TODO-1 

-	Problem with :	werdik 0000000001
		No full explanation of what kinds of job numbers can be made whether 
		to treat the number of zeros at the beginning or not. 
		Therefore, sorting (function) does not apply to this section and 
		sorts without regard to the zeros at the beginning of ID.
			
##	TODO-2
-	Problem whith Low or Big case character
		No full explanation of the task in which specifies data format. 
		For example whether the user names begin with a lowercase letter, 
		as well as such whether in general consist of a name with capital 
		letters. Therefore, the solution is not considered radical cases.
